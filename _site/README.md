## [Your Neighborhood Driver](http://www.yourneighborhooddriver.com)

This project is about a Philadelphia-based rideshare brand, operating under the Uber platform. It is a brochure intended to drive passive income and regular rideshare customers.

## The Pages
1. index.html: The home page.
1. about.html: Page containing cards with images and information about the **Your Neighborhood Driver business**.

    his/her rideshare business.

## Notes

The folders **ride**, **drive**, and **uzurv** each contain an **index.html** file. These folders allow clean urls (e.g. /ride, /drive, and /uzurv) for referral redirects. _config.yml contains a Ruby gem that allows github Pages to redirect.
